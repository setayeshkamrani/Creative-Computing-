# Creative-Computing-

I didn’t expect to do creative computing on GCD course, it feels like I’m in physics or computer science class in school, which I never liked, but the more I learn about it and play around with Arduino, it is actually fun. Personally, I find Arduino kit more interesting than doing simulation on TinkerCAD as Arduino involves physically creating the circuit which I find more real. When making a real circuit I find that if something isn’t working, I can make changes and try doing it a different way to find a solution quite quickly. Compared with making a simulation on TinkerCAD where I’ve no idea why it’s not working or how to fix the problem. However, everyone is different and has their own interests and ways of learning. It is good to try out both methods to find which interests you the most. 

### What I’ve learned that I never was taught before: 

**Open source software**

Open source is a computer software that the copyright holder allow people to use, edit and copy and even delete. Open source software is good for a collaborative project work as it is highly reliable.  

Examples of open-source: 
- Screenhive
- Screen Stopwatch 
- Activity Bubbles 

**Read.Me File**

Read.Me file are a text file on Github containing useful information about software program.  
If you need any help on READ.ME file, it is useful to use this website:

### Arduino Tutorials: in only 15 steps, you can do this! 

1)	Connect it from a 5 volt pin using jumper wire. 
2)	And put it in + line of breadboard (this will give the entire line power) 
3)	Place the switch on the middle of the breadboard, make sure it is connected to it. (it doesn’t matter which row you put the switch on - it can be anywhere) 
4)	To connect the switch to a 5 volt row, use a resistor – put one leg on the switch row and the other leg on the + power line.  
5)	For the LED light, the long leg goes to the power side which is toward the switch. 
6)	The short leg goes to the ground side 
7)	Put both leg in two different row. 
8)	To connect the long leg to the switch, use the jumper wire from the long leg to the switch. 
9)	To close the switch- connect the short leg to the ground, use the jumper wire on Arduino UNO R3 next to the long wire that was put in at the beginning. 
10)	The other leg goes to – power line on the breadboard. 
11)	Use other jumper wire to connect the short leg LED to the power line.  
12)	Put one leg onto the short leg LED row 
13)	And the other leg goes to – power line  
14)	Use USB cable to connect the board to the computers/laptop (use USB – A if your laptop is a Mac) 
15)	Press the button on the switch. The LED light should turn on. 

If it still doesn’t work, check each element by swapping different elements to see if will then work.  
You could also watch tutorial videos on the YouTube which is good for a visual learner.

In the end it would look like this:

### Don't give up! 

I know it can be complicated but it can also be interesting to learn. Let's have some fun!
