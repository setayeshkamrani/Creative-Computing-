# Creative-Computing-

I didn’t expect to do creative computing in GCD course, it feels like I’m in physics or computer science class in school which I never liked but the more I learn about it and play around with the Arduino, it is actually fun. Personally, I find Arduino kit more interesting than simulation on TinkerCAD as physically creating the circuit is more... everyone is different as they have their own interest. But it is good to try out both methods to find your interest. 

### What I’ve learned that I never was taught before: 

**History** 

**Open source** is a computer software that has copyright holder which allowed people to use, edit and copy and even delete. It is quite good for a collaboration project work which is highly reliable.  

Example of open-source: 
- Screenhive
- Screen Stopwatch 
- Activity Bubbles 

**Read.Me** file is a text file on Github containing useful information about software program.  
If you need any help on READ.ME file, it is useful to use this website:

### Arduino Tutorials: only 15 steps, you can do this! 

1)	Connect it from the 5 volt pin using jumper wire. 
2)	And put it in + line of breadboard (this will give the entire line power) 
3)	Place the switch on the middle of the breadboard, make sure it is connected to it. (it doesn’t matter which row you put it, it can be anywhere) 
4)	To connect the switch to 5 volt row, use the resistor – put one leg on the switch row and the other leg on + power line.  
5)	For the LED light, the long leg goes to the power side which is toward the switch. 
6)	The short leg goes to the ground side 
7)	Put both leg in two different row. 
8)	To connect the long leg to the switch, use the jumper wire from the long leg to the switch. 
9)	To close the switch- connect the short leg to the ground, use the jumper wire on Arduino uno r3 next to the long wire that was put in the beginning. 
10)	And the other leg goes to – power line on breadboard. 
11)	Use other jumper wire to connect the short leg led to the power line.  
12)	Put one leg onto the short leg LED row 
13)	And the other leg goes to – power line  
14)	Use USB cable to connect with the computers/laptop (use USB – A if your laptop is mac) 
15)	Press the button on the switch. The LED light would turn on. 

If it still doesn’t work, check each thing by swapping different thing to see if it is working.  
You could also watch the tutorial videos on the YouTube which is good for a visually learner.

In the end it would look like this:
